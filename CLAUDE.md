# Instructions for Claude

## Git Operations

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT commit or push changes unless the user explicitly asks you to.

- Wait for explicit permission before running `git commit`
- Wait for explicit permission before running `git push`
- The user will tell you when they want changes committed and pushed
